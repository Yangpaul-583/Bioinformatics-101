# Welcome to the Analyze Data with Python Skill Path
### See what you’ll learn in the Analyze Data with Python Skill Path.

---

Welcome to the Analyze Data with Python Skill Path! In this Skill Path, you’ll learn to analyze data statistically and communicate your findings with meaningful visualizations. If you are a beginner to Python, we recommend starting with the Learn Python for Data Science Skill Path, to learn the basics of Python and pandas while analyzing real datasets.

## Learning Objectives
After this Skill Path, you will be able to:

describe datasets statistically
communicate insights visually
test hypotheses for statistical significance
run an A/B test from start to finish

## Projects
You will demonstrate your knowledge in several projects that exist throughout the Skill Path.

Here’s a preview of some of the projects featured in this Skill Path:

Learning a programming language can be like learning a spoken language. It’s an incredible feeling when someone speaks to you and you understand what they’re saying! But it’s much more powerful when you are able to speak in response, using the new language with others.

*We’re excited for you to begin this journey!*

For a beginner approaching Markdown, the most fundamental step should be understanding its basic syntax. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that's easy to learn and use, and getting familiar with its core elements will provide a solid foundation for more advanced usage. Here are the key elements a beginner should start with:

1. **Headings**: Learn how to create different levels of headings using the `#` symbol.
    ```markdown
    # Heading 1
    ## Heading 2
    ### Heading 3
    ```

2. **Paragraphs and Line Breaks**: Understand how to create paragraphs and line breaks. Paragraphs are created by leaving a blank line between blocks of text, and line breaks are made by ending a line with two spaces.
    ```markdown
    This is a paragraph.

    This is another paragraph.
    ```

3. **Emphasis**: Know how to emphasize text using asterisks or underscores for bold and italics.
    ```markdown
    *Italic* or _Italic_

    **Bold** or __Bold__
    ```

4. **Lists**: Learn how to create ordered and unordered lists.
    ```markdown
    - Item 1
    - Item 2
        - Subitem

    1. First item
    2. Second item
    ```

5. **Links**: Understand how to add hyperlinks.
    ```markdown
    [Link text](https://example.com)
    ```

6. **Images**: Learn how to include images.
    ```markdown
    ![Alt text](image-url)
    ```

7. **Code**: Know how to format inline code and code blocks.
    ```markdown
    Inline `code`

    ```
    Code block
    ```
    ```

8. **Blockquotes**: Understand how to create blockquotes for quoting text.
    ```markdown
    > This is a blockquote.
    ```

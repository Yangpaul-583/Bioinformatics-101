# Analyze Data With R Introduction

## Welcome to the Analyze Data With R Skill Path! Let’s talk about what you’ll learn in this path.

Welcome to the Analyze Data With R Skill Path! This path will take you from writing your first line of R code all the way to creating a professional data science report.

The path is broken into 7 main sections.

1. What is R? — We’ll teach you some R basics and help you set up R on your own computer.
2. Introduction to Programming in R — Learn fundamental programming topics like loops, functions, and control flow. Also learn about different data structures that we’ll use throughout the course.
3. Statistics in R — Get a crash course in introductory statistics and learn how to use them in R.
4. Working with Data in R — Start working with larger datasets. Learn how to import and manipulate spreadsheet data in R.
5. Data Visualization in R — Learn how to make visualizations to help visually explain findings in your data.
6. Introduction to Machine Learning in R — Dip your toes into the world of machine learning as you begin to build statistical models using real data.
7. Capstone Project — Put all of your knowledge to the test and build a data report based on a topic of your choosing.
8. Throughout the path, you’ll work on some really fun projects using real data! Take a look below for a preview of the type of project you’ll be working on.

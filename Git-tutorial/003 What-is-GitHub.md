# **What is GitHub?**

**Learn how to sign up for a GitHub account and share your code**

## **What is GitHub?**

One of the best ways to share what you’ve been learning with other people is to put your code on GitHub. GitHub is both a website and a service that facilitates software development by allowing you to store your code in containers, called *repositories*, and by tracking changes made to your code. In addition, it offers a hosting service and tools to build, test, and deploy code.

GitHub uses **Git, a version-control development tool**, to manage your projects by tracking changes to files and allowing multiple people to work on the same project. Although both GitHub and Git have similar names, GitHub is a service, while Git is a development tool that can be used by you outside of and without GitHub.

## **Why is GitHub important?**

There are many reasons why knowing about GitHub is important for your personal growth as a developer. A large part of the appeal of Github is the access it grants developers to the massive community of developers around the world who openly share their code, projects, and software development tools with each other. Therefore, if you want to continue working on your Git skills, creating your programming portfolio, or finding work, GitHub can help.

## **How to Sign Up for an Account**

Now that you’re aware of GitHub’s benefits, you probably want to sign up for an account and try it out yourself. First, navigate to the home page of the GitHub website, [https://github.com](https://github.com/).

You can click on the **Sign Up** button in the upper right corner or fill out your email and click on **Sign up for GitHub**, as highlighted in this screenshot:

![https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-is-github/image-1-signup.png](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-is-github/image-1-signup.png)

You’ll be taken to a page asking you to fill out your email. If you did so on the home page, it will already be filled out for you. If it isn’t filled out, enter the email you wish to use.

![https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-is-github/image-2-email.png](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-is-github/image-2-email.png)

Pick an email that you’re comfortable sharing with peers and potential hires. Because of the way Git works, it’s important to note that your email can be exposed publicly when you make a pull request or merge in code to a repository, making it visible to anyone looking through your projects. When you sign up for a new GitHub account, your email address is hidden by default.

Once you have an email entered, click on “continue.” GitHub will then ask you to create a password. Fill out a password for your new account.

![https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-is-github/image-3-password.png](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-is-github/image-3-password.png)

When you click on “continue,” GitHub will then ask you for a username. Fill out the user name you would like to use (you may need to try a few times to find one that’s available).

![https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-is-github/Image-4-username.png](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-is-github/Image-4-username.png)

Like with email addresses, when choosing a username, it’s wise to choose one you wouldn’t mind future employers or colleagues seeing. A combination of your first and last name, like **`firstnamelastname`**, or using initials, like **`i_lastname`**, are good because they make it easy to find you on GitHub or identify you when you make [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) or [reviews](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews). Remember, you’re likely using this account to share or access code.

Also be aware that usernames are first come, first serve and may not be available if someone else already claimed the username. Additionally, usernames may only contain alphanumeric characters and hyphens are not allowed at the beginning or end.

After you click on “continue,” GitHub will prompt to ask if you want to receive product updates and announcements. Make your selection and click “continue,” again. GitHub will then prompt you to solve a puzzle to prove you’re a human being. Click on “Verify” to view the puzzle.

Once you submit the solution to the puzzle, a “Create Account” button will appear. Click on it and GitHub will prompt you for an 8-digit code. GitHub will send you the code to the email you entered earlier. Enter the code from the email and GitHub will create your account.

## **Settings**

Once your account is created, GitHub will ask a couple of questions to personalize your experience. Fill these out or click on the “skip personalization” link at the bottom of the page.

You should now see a personal dashboard with a section for your projects and some messages:

![https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-is-github/image-5-dashboard.png](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-is-github/image-5-dashboard.png)

Now you have your own GitHub account! You can continue to customize your account by:

- [setting your email to private](https://github.blog/2017-04-11-private-emails-now-more-private/)
- [setting up two-factor authentication](https://github.blog/2013-09-03-two-factor-authentication/)

That’s it; you now have your very own GitHub account. 🎉

## **Recap**

With more people working remotely and with teams distributed across different countries and time zones, GitHub and Git can be valuable tools for collaborating on projects. You can also use GitHub to work on any file-based project, such as writing documentation.

Let’s review what you did in this article:

- Learned that GitHub is both a website and service for storing and sharing code
- Learned that GitHub uses Git to facilitate software development by tracking changes
- Created your own GitHub account
- Enabled security features like keeping your email private and turning on two-factor authentication

## **Going Further**

Once you feel comfortable navigating GitHub, consider doing the following:

- [Add information about yourself](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/personalizing-your-profile) in your profile, including an avatar, bio, location, etc.
- [Set your status](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/personalizing-your-profile#setting-a-status) in your profile to let people know what you’re doing.
- If you feel comfortable enough with Git, you can take a look at [this article on GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), GitHub’s hosting service that allows you to create a personal website, “project site”, based on a repository to make your portfolio site.
- If you’re interested in paid accounts, GitHub has a [pricing page](https://github.com/pricing) with various types of accounts and features you can look at.

Show the world what you can do with your code!

# **Set Up with Git and GitHub**

**Never fear losing work with this professional versioning system**

In this tutorial, we walk through the process for using Git locally on your personal computer and using GitHub to back it up. Specifically, we’ll walk through creating your personal GitHub account, setting up Git on your computer, starting your first Git repository, and connecting that repository to a GitHub repository.

This tutorial assumes that you’ve completed the lessons on Learn the Command Line and Learn Git. Now, prepare to use those skills on your personal computer! If some steps in this tutorial are confusing, have no fear; it will all come together by the end.

## **What are Git and GitHub?**

This tutorial refers to Git and GitHub repeatedly. *Git* is a widely-used version control system used to manage code. Git allows you to save drafts of your code so that you can look back at previous versions and potentially undo complicated errors. A project managed with Git is called a *Git repository*.

*GitHub* is a popular hosting service for Git repositories. GitHub allows you to store your local Git repositories in the cloud. With GitHub, you can backup your personal files, share your code, and collaborate with others.

In short, GitHub is a tool for working with Git. There are other services to host Git repositories, but GitHub is a trusted, free service used by organizations across the world, big and small.

## **Create a GitHub Account**

To use GitHub, you will need a GitHub account.

In your own browser:

1. Open a new browser tab
2. Navigate to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)
3. Create an account

If you already have a GitHub account, continue to the next exercise.

After you sign up, you will receive a verification e-mail. Be sure to verify your e-mail address to GitHub by following the instructions in that e-mail.

## **Git Setup for Mac and Windows**

Next, we will set up Git on your personal computer. Follow the instructions for your operating system.

### **Mac users:**

1. Launch the ***Terminal*** application. You can find it in **/Applications/Utilities/**. You can also use the ***Spotlight*** search tool (the little magnifying glass in the top right of your screen) to search for ***Terminal***. Once ***Spotlight*** locates it, click on the result that says ***Terminal***.

2. When ***Terminal*** opens, type in **`git`** and press enter.

3. If you don’t already have Git installed, a dialog will appear saying that “The ‘git’ command requires the command line developer tools. Would you like to install the tools now?” Click “Install”.

![https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_xcode_prompt.png](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_xcode_prompt.png)

Then click “Agree to the Terms of Service” when requested.

![https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_xcode_terms.png](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_xcode_terms.png)

4. When the download finishes, the installer will go away on its own signifying that Git is now installed! Click “Done” to finish the installation process.

![https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_xcode_finished.png](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_xcode_finished.png)

Now skip down to the “Final Setup” section below to finish setting up.

### **Windows users:**

This portion of the guide assumes you have already installed a program called Git Bash which allows us access to Git on Windows. If you have not installed Git Bash, please refer to the previous tutorial on Command Line Interface (CLI) Setup and follow the instructions for installing Git Bash on Windows. Once you complete that you can continue with this guide.

1. Open the Start menu and search for the app, git bash. You should see ‘Git Bash Desktop app’ appear. Press Enter or click on the Git Bash icon to open the app.

![https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_gitbash_start.png](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_gitbash_start.png)

A new window will open that looks like this:

![https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_gitbash_shell_edited.png](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_gitbash_shell_edited.png)

This window is our CLI, where we will use our Git commands.

2. If you want to make sure that Git is installed, run **`git --version`** in the CLI. You should see a response that gives you the version of Git installed. It will look like this:

![https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_gitbash_test_edited.png](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_gitbash_test_edited.png)

Git can now be used in the Git Bash app!

Continue on to finish setting up.

### **Final Setup**

1. Navigate to GitHub’s articles on setting up your [Git username](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/setting-your-username-in-git#setting-your-git-username-for-every-repository-on-your-computer) and [email](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address#setting-your-commit-email-address-in-git) and follow the instructions for each using Git Bash.
2. GitHub offers two authentication options, HTTPS and SSH, to keep your work secure. This is a security measure that prevents anyone who isn’t authorized from making changes to your GitHub repository. In this article, we will use HTTPS.
    - To authenticate yourself in the terminal, you will need to generate a *Personal Access Token* on GitHub. Navigate to GitHub’s article on [creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) and follow the instructions for creating a classic token. Be sure to check the box that grants the token **`repo`** scope — this will allow you to write to the repository from the terminal on your machine.
    - Once you get the token, make sure to copy it or keep the page open — you will not be able to view the token again once you navigate away from the page and you’ll need it later in the instructions!

## **Try It Out!**

Now you have everything you need to practice your Git skills on your local computer. Take a moment to run the commands below to initialize a Git repository. We will use this Git repository again later in this tutorial so make sure you complete these steps exactly as described.

1. **`mkdir git_practice`** to make a new directory to practice.
2. **`cd git_practice`** to make the new directory your working directory.
3. **`git init`** to turn the current, empty directory into a fresh Git repository.
4. **`echo "Hello Git and GitHub" >> README.txt`** to create a new README file (more on this later) with some sample text.
5. **`git add README.txt`** to add the new file to the Git staging area.
6. **`git commit -m "First commit"`** to make your first commit with the new README file.

## **Your First Remote Repository on GitHub**

Finally, we’ll create a repository on GitHub and then link it to a local repository on your computer. This allows you to backup your work constantly and safely, so you never need to worry about losing your work again!

Now, let’s connect our local Git repository to GitHub.

### **Instructions**

1. In your Command Line Interface, make sure your current working directory is your new Git repository. Navigate there if not.

2. Check the status of which files and folders are new or have been edited. There should be no files modified.

```bash
$ git status
```

3. On GitHub, create a new repository by clicking the

**New repository**

button on the home page.

![https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/setup-git-github/new_repo_button.svg](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/setup-git-github/new_repo_button.svg)

4. On the new repository page, give your repository a name. It’s not necessary, but it would be convenient to name it the same as the directory,

**git_practice**

After naming the repository, click

**Create repository**

![https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/setup-git-github/new_repo_creation.svg](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/setup-git-github/new_repo_creation.svg)

5. After creating a repository, GitHub displays the repository page. At the top of the page, make sure “HTTPS” is selected.

![https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/setup-git-github/new_repo_setup_https.svg](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/setup-git-github/new_repo_setup_https.svg)

6.The repository is empty, so it’s time to connect it to your existing work. Copy the Git commands on the GitHub page, under the title “…or push an existing repository from the command line”, and paste them into your Command Line Interface. Running these commands will add a remote repository, and then push your local repository to the remote repository.

When asked for a username and password, type in your GitHub username as the username and paste your personal access token as the password, pressing

Enter

(or

return

) after each. Don’t be alarmed if you can’t see the characters you are typing, they are intentionally hidden as a security measure.

![https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/setup-git-github/new_repo_setup_push.svg](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/setup-git-github/new_repo_setup_push.svg)

7. Once your Command Line Interface reports that the push is complete, refresh the page on GitHub. You should now see the text you wrote earlier in the README file, “Hello Git and GitHub.”

GitHub automatically displays the contents of a file named **README.txt** if it exists in the repository. The README file is the perfect place to write a description of your project.

There you have it! Your first GitHub repository, linked to your local Git repository. You’ve taken some huge leaps, so be proud! Now you can use your knowledge of Git to track progress on your local computer and push that progress to GitHub whenever you want. You can rest easy knowing that each step of your progress is safely stored in GitHub.

# THE GITHUB FLOW

## Introduction

In this lesson, we'll discuss the flow of using GitHub with your code development process. When working on a project, things can scale rather quickly. Following a specific workflow allows the project to move in more orderly way.

Remember that Git is defined as a version control system that's maintained on your local system. It helps you manage and record your source code history.
GitHub, on the other hand, is a hosting service for repositories. Simply put, Git is the tool and GitHub is the service for projects that use Git.
In this lesson we'll take a look at the basic workflow used with GitHub, which goes like this:

[https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/github-flow/github-flow-diagram/index.html](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/github-flow/github-flow-diagram/index.html)

1. Create a branch
2. Commit changes
3. Create a pull request
4. Review pull request
5. Merge and delete branch

By sticking to that workflow, team members are able to isolate their work and avoid any conflicting code from being merged. In the following lesson, we'll take a deeper look at each of these steps.

---

# Managing Branches

Whenever we're working on a team creating multiple versions of a project code, it's important to isolate each teammate's work in order to avoid any conflicts. With Git, each teammate can create their own branch off of the main project in order to work on bug-fixes, new features, experimental code, etc.

A branch is essentially a divergence from the main project. When you branch out, git is essentially making a new state of your current code, upon which you can work, without affecting the important main state of the code. One can create as many branches as they wish and even create branches off of other branches.

By using separate branches, the main project remains intact and unaffected before the changes are reviewed and merged into the project.

Each repository can have one or more branches. The main branch - the one where all changes eventually get merged back into, is called main. The main branch is usually the working version of a project and contains the production code, so it's very important to only merge clean and correct code into it!

When someone wants to create a new feature, fix a bug, or just experiment, they should always create their own branch with a descriptive name.

Each team will adopt their own best practices when working together and figuring out naming conventions.
For example, the branch name

 `carlos_feature_dashboard_notifications` 

includes the author, branch type, and short branch description. Other teams may pick branch names to correspond to ticket numbers from their project management tool.

---

# Adding and Committing Changes

Let's assume you were recently assigned to a team to develop a feature for an app. You clone (download) the entire app repository from GitHub, create a new branch from the main branch for your feature, and begin coding a new file in your local Git environment.

After testing your code and ensuring that everything is running correctly, it's time to commit the changes and push them to the remote repository!

As a refresher, the git commit command records changes to one or more files in your branch, assigning the commit a unique ID that identifies who created the changes, what changes were made, and when the changes were committed.

Add a commit message describing your work and finally, push the commit to the remote GitHub repository.

---

# Creating a Pull Request

At this point, your work is ready to be reviewed before it's integrated into the official project. You'll start by opening a pull request.
Pull requests on GitHub allow collaborators to review and give feedback on proposed code changes before they are merged into the main branch. Through a process of discussion and potentially some extra code changes, the pull request can be ultimately approved, which means you can merge the changes into the official project on the main branch.

When creating pull requests, it's imperative that you include as much relevant detail in the description as possible in order to save review time. Add any comments or images that might be useful for your reviewer.

It's also essential to ensure that your code is running properly with the updated repository in order to prevent anything from crashing. Lastly, you don't want to submit a pull request with 50 files containing a plethora of changes - instead, stick to smaller-sized pull requests since they're easier and faster to review.

---

# Reviewing and Merging a Pull Request

Once you've created a pull request, other members in your team can review it up on GitHub.

The pull request should include a description and GitHub will display all the files with the changes created. Each line of code will have a clickable "+" button where you can add a comment in regards to the line.

While reviewing, it's important to be constructive with feedback and be precise about what needs to be changed. Here are few best practices when reviewing code:

- Don't only comment on what should be changed, but why it should be changed. Feel free to provide resources to make your point.
- Be as clear as possible with your comments and make sure to be clear as to what to modify.
- Look at the bigger picture and try to spot potential errors. Would the submitted code produce any obstacles if the project scales?

Once all the feedback is added, collaborators can click on "Submit Review" and wait for a response. If all goes well, the pull request will eventually be merged into main!

---

# Deleting a Branch and Review

Once changes are merged, in order to keep things organized and managed, it's imperative to only keep active branches and delete the closed ones.

With that in place, this wraps up the flow of working on a project using Github. We explored:

- The importance of creating branches and isolating work from the main branch.
- Best practices of naming branches and making commits on branches.
- What a pull request is: a discussion page for a set of code changes between one branch and another.
- Merging a branch and delete it once it's merged.

This covers the main steps of working with a team and managing the workflow using Github.

Github provides us with a number of useful tools that expand on Git functionality, especially if we're collaborating with teammates!

# Practice

**Deleting a Branch**

![https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/Learn-Git/Review-Cards/learn-git-remove-branch.png](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/Learn-Git/Review-Cards/learn-git-remove-branch.png)

In Git, the **`git branch -d branch_name`** command is used to delete the **`branch_name`** branch. It’s good practice to delete a branch after it has been merged into the **`master`** branch.

**The Main Branch**

```bash
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/ccuser/new-project/.git/
$ echo "Hello World!" >> hello.txt
$ git add hello.txt 
$ git commit -m 'initial commit'
[master (root-commit) bb0e565] initial commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 hello.txt
$ git branch
* master
```

In Git, the main project is completed on the **`main`** branch. Making your first commit in a new git repository will automatically create a **`main`** branch. Create new branches from the **`main`** branch to develop new features for a project. These branches can be merged into **`main`** at a later time to incorporate the new features. You can use **`git branch`** to check what branch you’re on.

**Pull Requests on GitHub**

![https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-makes-good-pull-request/branch-comparison.png](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-makes-good-pull-request/branch-comparison.png)

A pull request is a feature of GitHub and other source code management tools that allow a repository’s collaborators to review and give feedback on proposed code changes before they are accepted and merged to another branch, usually the main branch. Each pull request creates a discussion forum that can be used by reviewers and authors alike to highlight or add comments to a single line of code or chunk of code, add videos or images, etc.

Going through the pull request process can increase group knowledge, improve product quality, and develop professional skills through group critique.

**Committing Your Code**

```bash
$ git commit -m "Added About section to README"
[master 9d63f80] Added About section to README
1 file changed, 10 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

The **`git commit -m "log message here"`** command creates a new commit containing:

- The current contents of the staging area
- A log message describing the changes to the repository

A commit is the last step in our Git workflow. A commit permanently stores changes from the staging area inside the repository. This command is almost always used in conjunction with the **`git add`** command as **`git add`** is used to add files to the staging area.
